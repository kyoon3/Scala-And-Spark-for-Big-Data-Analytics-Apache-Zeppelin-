According to [3], the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is defined as an IoT where things are capable of establishing social relationships with other objects, autonomously with respect to humans. In this way, a social network of objects is created. The adoption of the SIoT paradigm presents several advantages:
There is no doubt that many applications and services should in the future be associated with groups of objects, whose individuality will be 'sacrificed' to the overall interest of providing services to users; this is the case, for example, of applications involving the use of swarm intelligence and swarm robotics. It is equally true that several applications will either involve 'au pair' interactions among objects, wherein each object will be the bearer of its specific service to the community, or asymmetric interactions (as, for example, in services based on Bluetooth, Zigbee, 6LoWPAN networks of sensors/actuators or RFID identification systems). In a further category of services, objects condition their friendship's relationship to the achievement of mutual benefits (this is the case, for example, of cooperative services designed to reduce the energy consumption of wireless devices). Those described are sample scenarios where interactions among objects assume the shape of social interactions that mimic the four "elementary relational models" observed in human behaviour.
To implement the depicted scenarios, objects should start establishing social relationships on the basis of the object profile, activities (such as movements), and interests (applications deployed on the object and services it implements). These relationships can also be categorized according to the events that trigger their establishment, as depicted in Figure 1: a 'co-location' relationship may be established among objects (either homogeneous or heterogeneous) used always in the same place; a 'co-work' relationship may be established whenever objects collaborate to provide a common IoT application (as in case of objects that come in touch and cooperate for applications such as emergency response, telemedicine, etc.); a 'parental' relationship may be related to objects belonging to the same production batch (same model, same construction period, and same manufacturer); a 'social' relationship may be created when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, because their owners come in touch with each other during their lives; a 'co-ownership' relationship may be established among heterogeneous objects which belong to the same user.
